AnomaData: Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance

Project Overview:-
   AnomaData is a predictive maintenance system designed to identify machine anomalies and prevent breakdowns. 
   This project involves analyzing time-series data to detect anomalies using various machine learning techniques.

Objectives:-

   1. Predict Machine Breakdowns: Detect anomalies in equipment data to perform maintenance before failures occur.
   2. Data Analysis: Process and analyze a dataset with 18,000+ rows containing time-series data and binary labels for anomalies.
   3. Model Development: Implement and evaluate machine learning models for anomaly detection.

Features:-

   1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed data patterns and quality using statistical methods and visualizations.
   2. Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, outliers, and performed data normalization.
   3. Feature Engineering: Created new features from the time-series data, including year, month, day, and hour.
   4. Model Selection: Developed and evaluated models using Random Forest and logistic regression.
   5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Improved model performance with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
   6. Deployment: Saved the trained model for future use.
